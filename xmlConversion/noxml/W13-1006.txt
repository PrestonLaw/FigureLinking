		We discuss previous works employing WSMs and present differences in the proposed approaches which include types of WSMs, corpora, preprocessing techniques, methods for determining compositionality, and evaluation testbeds.
		We also present results of our own approach for determining the semantic compositionality based on comparing distributional vectors of expressions and their components.
		The vectors were obtained by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) applied to the ukWaC corpus.
		Our results outperform those of all the participants in the Distributional Semantics and Compositionality (DISCO) 2011 shared task.
	
	
			A word expression is semantically compositional if its meaning can be understood from the literal meaning of its components.
			Therefore, semantically compositional expressions involve e.g. “small island” or “hot water”; on the other hand, semantically non-compositional expressions are e.g. “red tape” or “kick the bucket”.
			The notion of compositionality is closely related to idiomacy – the higher the compositionality the lower the idiomacy and vice versa (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2010).
			Non-compositional expressions are often referred to as Multiword Expressions (MWEs).
			Baldwin and Kim (2010) differentiate the following sub-types of compositionality: lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and statistical.
			This paper is concerned with semantic compositionality.
			Compositionality as a feature of word expressions is not discrete.
			Instead, expressions populate a continuum between two extremes: idioms and free word combinations (McCarthy et al., 2003; Bannard et al., 2003; Katz, 2006; Fazly, 2007; Baldwin and Kim, 2010; Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011).
			Typical examples of expressions between the two extremes are “zebra crossing” or “blind alley”.
			Our research in compositionality is motivated by the hypothesis that a special treatment of semantically non-compositional expressions can improve results in various Natural Language Processing (NPL) tasks, as shown for example by Acosta et al.
			(2011), who utilized MWEs in Information Retrieval (IR).
			Besides that, there are other NLP applications that can benefit from knowing the degree of compositionality of expressions such as machine translation (Carpuat and Diab, 2010), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), word sense disambiguation (Finlayson and Kulkarni, 2011), part-of-speech (POS) tagging and parsing (Seretan, 2008) as listed in Ramisch (2012).
			The main goal of this paper is to present an analysis of previous approaches using WSMs for determining the semantic compositionality of expressions.
			The analysis can be found in Section 2.
			A special attention is paid to the evaluation of the proposed models that is described in Section 3.
			Section 4 presents our first intuitive experimental setup and results of LSA applied to the DISCO 2011 task.
			Section 5 concludes the paper.

			Expressions Determined by WSMs Several recent works, including Lin (1999), Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Baldwin et al.
			(2003), McCarthy et al.
			(2003), Katz (2006), Johannsen et al.
			(2011), Reddy et al.
			(2011a), and Krcˇma´ˇr et al.
			(2012), show the ability of methods based on WSMs to capture the degree of semantic compositionality of word expressions.
			We analyse the proposed methods and discuss their differences.
			As further described in detail and summarized in Table 1, the approaches differ in the type of WSMs, corpora, pre- processing techniques, methods for determining the compositionality, datasets for evaluation, and methods of evaluation itself.
			Our understanding of WSM is in agreement with Sahlgren (2006): “The word space model is a computational model of word meaning that utilizes the distributional patterns of words collected over large text data to represent semantic similarity between words in terms of spatial proximity”.
			For more information on WSMs, see e.g. Turney and Pan- tel (2010), Jurgens and Stevens (2010), or Sahlgren (2006).
			WSMs and their parameters WSMs can be built by different algorithms including LSA (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996), Random Indexing (RI) (Sahlgren, 2005), and Correlated Occurrence Analogue to Lexical Semantics (COALS) (Rohde et al., 2005).
			Every algorithm has its own specifics and can be configured in different ways.
			The configuration usually involves e.g. the choice of context size, weighting functions, or normalizing functions.
			While Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Baldwin et al.
			(2003), and Katz (2006) addopted LSA-based approaches, Johannsen et al.
			(2011) and Krcˇma´ˇr et al.
			(2012) employ COALS; the others use their own specific WSMs.
			Corpora and text preprocessing Using different corpora and their preprocessing naturally leads to different WSMs.
			The preprocessing can differ e.g. in the choice of used word forms or in removal/retaining of low-frequency words.
			For example, while Lin (1999) employs a 125-million-word newspaper corpus, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) use a 6.7-million-word subset of the TREC databases, Baldwin et al.
			(2003) base their experiments on 90 million words from the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000).
			Krcˇma´ˇr et al.
			(2012), Johannsen et al.
			(2011), and Reddy et al.
			(2011a) use the ukWaC corpus, consisting of 1.9 billion words from web texts (Baroni et al., 2009).
			As for preprocessing, Lin (1999) extracts triples with dependency relationships, Baldwin et al.
			(2003), Reddy et al.
			(2011a), and Krcˇma´ˇr et al.
			(2012) concatenate word lemmas with their POS categories.
			Johannsen et al.
			(2011) use word lemmas and remove low-frequency words while Reddy et al.
			(2011a), for example, keep only frequent content words.
			Methods We have identified three basic methods for determining semantic compositionality: 1) The substitutability-based methods exploit the fact that replacing components of non- compositional expressions by words which are similar leads to anti-collocations (Pearce, 2002).
			Then, frequency or mutual information of such expressions (anti-collocations) is compared with the frequency or mutual information of the original expressions.
			For example, consider expected occurrence counts of “hot dog” and its anti-collocations such as “warm dog” or “hot terrier”.
			2) The component-based methods, utilized for example by Baldwin et al.
			(2003) or Johannsen et al.
			(2011), compare the distributional characteristics of expressions and their components.
			The context vectors expected to be different from each other are e.g. the vector representing the expression “hot dog” and the vector representing the word “dog”.
			3) The compositionality-based methods compare two vectors of each analysed expression: the true co-occurrence vector of an expression and the vector obtained from vectors corresponding to the components of the expression using a compositionality function (Reddy et al., 2011a).
			The most common compositionality functions are vector addition or pointwise vector multiplication (Mitchell and La- pata, 2008).
			For example, the vectors for “hot dog” and “hot”⊕“dog” are supposed to be different.
			Evaluation datasets There is still no consensus on how to evaluate models determining semantic compositionality.

			dency to exploit manually annotated data from a specific corpus, ranging from semantically compositional to non-compositional expressions (McCarthy et al., 2003; Katz, 2006; Johannsen et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2011a; Krcˇma´ˇr et al., 2012).
			This approach, as opposed to the methods based on dictionaries of MWEs (idioms) or Word- net (Miller, 1995), has the following advantages: Firstly, the classification of a manually annotated data is not binary but finer-grained, enabling the evaluation to be more detailed.
			Secondly, the low- coverage problem of dictionaries, which originates for example due to the facts that new MWEs still arise or are domain specific, is avoided.1 For example, Lin (1999), Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Baldwin et al.
			(2003) used Wordnet or other dictionary- type resources.
	
	
			This section discusses evaluation methods including average point difference (APD), Spearman and Kendall correlations, and precision of classification (PoC) suggested by Biemann and Giesbrecht (2011); Precision/nBest, Recall/nBest and Precision/Recall curves proposed by Evert (2005); and Average Precision used by Pecina (2009).
			Our evaluation is based on the English part of the manually annotated datasets DISCO 2011 (Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011), further referred to as DISCO-En- Gold.
			Disco-En-Gold consists of 349 expressions divided into training (TrainD), validation (ValD), and test data (TestD) manually assigned scores from 0 to 100, indicating the level of compositionality (the lower the score the lower the compositionality and vice versa).
			The expressions are of the following types: adjective-noun (AN), verb-object (VO), and subject-verb (SV).
			Based on the numerical scores, the expressions are also classified into three disjoint classes (coarse scores): low, medium, and high com- positional.2 A sample of the Disco-En-Gold data is presented in Table 2.
			Comparison of evaluation methods The purpose of the DISCO workshop was to find the best methods for determining semantic compositionality.
			The participants were asked to create systems capable of assigning the numerical values closest to the ones assigned by the annotators (Gold values).
			The proposed APD evaluation measure is calculated as the mean difference between the particular systems’ val 1 The consequence of using a low-coverage dictionary can.

			ues and the Gold values assigned to the same expressions.
			PoC is defined as the ratio of correct coarse predictions to the number of all the predictions.
			Following Krcˇma´ˇr et al.
			(2012), we argue that for the purpose of comparison of the methods, the values assigned to a set of expressions by a certain model are not as important as is the ranking of the expressions (which is not sensitive to the original distribution of compositionality values).
			Similarly as Evert (2005), Pecina (2009), and Krcˇma´ˇr et al.
			(2012) we adopt evaluation based on ranking (although the measures such as PoC or APD might provide useful information too).
			Evaluation based on ranking can be realized by measuring ranked correlations (Spearman and Kendall) or Precision/Recall scores and curves commonly used e.g. in IR (Manning et al., 2008).
			In IR, Precision is defined as the ratio of found relevant documents to all the retrieved documents with regards to a user’s query.
			Recall is defined as the ratio of found relevant documents to all the relevant documents in a test set to the user’s query.
			The Precision/Recall curve is a curve depicting the dependency of Precision upon Recall.
			Analogously, the scheme can be used for evaluation of the methods finding semantically non-compositional expressions.
			However, estimation of Recall is not possible without knowledge of the correct class3 for every expression in a corpus.
			To bypass this, Evert (2005) calculates Recall with respect to the set of annotated data divided into non-compositional and compositional classes.
			The Precision/nBest, Recall/nBest, and Precision/Recall curves for the LSA experiment 3 A semantically non-compositional expression or a semantically compositional expressions described in the following section are depicted in Figures 1 and 2.
			Evert’s (2005) curves allow us to visually compare the results of the methods in more detail.
			To facilitate comparison of several methods, we also suggest using average precision (AP) adopted from Pecina (2009), which reduces information provided by a single Precision/Recall curve to one value.
			AP is defined as a mean Precision at all the values of Recall different from zero.
	
	
			LSA is WSM based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) factorization (Deerwester et al., 1990) applied to the co-occurrence matrix.
			In the matrix, the numbers of word occurrences in specified contexts4 are stored.
			The row vectors of the matrix capture the word meanings.5 The idea of using SVD is to project vectors corresponding to the words into a lower-dimensional space and thus bring the vectors of words with similar meaning near to each other.
			We built LSA WSM and applied the component- based method to Disco-En-Gold.
			We used our own modification of the LSA algorithm originally implemented in the S-Space package (Jurgens and Stevens, 2010).
			The modification lies in treating expressions and handling stopwords.
			Specifically, we added vectors for the examined expressions to WSM in such a way that the original vectors for words were preserved.
			This differentiates our approach e.g. from Baldwin et al.
			(2003) or Johannsen et al.
			(2011) who label the expressions ahead of time and build WSMs treating them as single words.
			Treating the expressions as the single words affects the WSM vectors of their constituents.
			As an example, consider the replacement of occurrences of “short distance” by e.g. the EXP#123 label.
			This affects the WSM vectors of “short” and “distance” since the numbers of their occurrences and the numbers of contexts they occur in drops.
			Consequently, this also affects the methods for determining the compositionality which are based upon using the vectors of 4 The commonly used contexts for words are documents or the preceding and following words in a specified window.

			expressions’ constituents.
			As for treating stopwords, we mapped the trigram expressions containing the determiners “the”, “a”, or “an” as the middle word to the corresponding bi- gram expressions without the determiners.
			The intuition is to extract more precise co-occurrence vectors for the VO expressions often containing some intervening determiner.
			As an example, compare the occurrences of “reinvent wheel” and “reinvent (determiner) wheel” in the ukWaC corpus which are 27 and 623, respectively, or the occurrences of “cross bridge” and “cross (determiner) bridge” being 50 and 1050, respectively.6 We built LSA WSM from the whole ukWaC POS-tagged corpus for all the word lemmas concatenated with their POS tags excluding stopwords.
			We treated the following strings as stopwords: the lemmas with frequency below 50 (omitting low- frequency words), the strings containing two adjacent non-letter characters (omitting strings such as web addresses and sequences of e.g. star symbols), and lemmas with a different POS tag from noun, proper noun, adjective, verb, and adverb (omitting closed-class words).
			As contexts, the entire documents were used.
			The co-occurrence matrix for words was normalized by applying the log-entropy transformation and reduced to 300 dimensions.
			Using these settings, Landauer and Dumais (1997) obtained the best results.
			Finally, the co-occurrence vectors of expressions were expressed in the lower-dimensional space of words in a manner analogous to how a user’s query is being expressed in lower-dimensional space of documents in IR (Berry et al., 1995).
			The Disco- En-Gold expressions were sorted in ascending order by the average cosine similarity between the vectors corresponding to the expressions and the vectors corresponding to their components.
			Evaluation We have not tried to find the optimal parameter settings for the LSA-based model yet.
			Therefore, we present the results on the concatenation of TrainD with ValD giving us TrainValD and on TestD.
			The expressions “leading edge” and “broken link” were removed from TestD because they occur in the ukWaC corpus assigned with the
	
	
			required POS tags less than 50 times.
			APs with the Spearman and Kendall correlations between the compositionality values assigned by the LSA-based model and the Gold values are depicted in Table 3.
			The Spearman correlations of the LSA model applied to the whole TrainValD and TestD are highly significant with p-values < 0.001.
			For the AP evaluation, the expressions with numerical values less or equal to 50 were classified as non-compositional7, giving us the ratio of non-compositional expressions in TrainValD and TestD equal to 0.26 and 0.20, respectively.
			The Precision/nBest and Recall/nBest graphs corresponding to the LSA-based model applied to TestD are depicted in Figure 1.
			The Precision/Recall graphs corresponding to the LSA-based model applied to TrainD and TestD are depicted in Figure 2.
			For comparison, the graphs in Figures 1 and 2 also show the curves corresponding to the evaluation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI).8 The co- occurrence statistics of the expressions in Disco-En- Gold was extracted from the window of size three, sliding through the whole lemmatized ukWaC corpus.
			Discussion As suggested in Section 3, we compare the results of the methods using Spearman and Kendall correlations, AP, and Everts’ curves.
			We present the results of the LSA and PMI models alongside the results of the best performing models participating in the DISCO task.
			Namely, Table 3 presents the correlation values of our models, the best performing WSM-based model (Reddy et al., 2011b), the best performing model based upon association measures (Chakraborty et al., 2011), and random baseline models.
			The poor results achieved by employing PMI are similar to the results of random baselines and in accordance with those of participants of the DISCO workshop (Chakraborty et al., 2011).
			We hypothesize that the PMI-based model incorrectly assigns low values of semantic compositionality (high val 7 Choice of this value can affect the results.

			For example, we observed that the calculated values of PMI for “international airport” and “religious belief” were high.
			To the contrary, our results achieved by employing the LSA model are statistically significant and better than those of all the participants of the DISCO workshop.
			However, the data set is probably not large enough to provide statistically reliable comparison of the methods and it is not clear how reliable the dataset itself is (the interannotator agreement was not analyzed) and therefore we can not make any hard conclusions.
			5 Conclusion.
			We analysed the previous works applying WSMs for determining the semantic compositionality of expressions.
			We discussed and summarized the majority of techniques presented in the papers.
			Our analysis reveals a large diversity of approaches which leads to incomparable results (Table 1).
			Since it has been shown that WSMs can serve as good predic- tors of semantic compositionality, we aim to create a comparative study of the approaches.
			Our analysis implies to evaluate the proposed approaches using human annotated data and evaluation techniques based on ranking.
			Namely, we suggest using Spearman and Kendall correlations, Precision/nBest, Recall/nBest, Precision/Recall curves, and AP.
			Using the suggested evaluation techniques, we present the results of our first experiments exploiting LSA (Figures 1, 2 and Table 3).
			The results of the LSA-based model, compared with random baselines, PMI-based model, and all the WSM-based and statistical-based models proposed by the participants of the DISCO task, are very promising.
