		We propose a Gibbs sampler for fully Bayesian inference in IBM Model 1, integrating over all possible parameter values in finding the alignment distribution.
		We show that Bayesian inference outperforms EM in all of the tested language pairs, domains and data set sizes, by up to 2.99 BLEU points.
		We also show that the proposed method effectively addresses the well-known rare word problem in EM-estimated models; and at the same time induces a much smaller dictionary of bilingual word-pairs.
	
	
			Word alignment is a crucial early step in the training of most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, in which the estimated alignments are used for constraining the set of candidates in phrase/grammar extraction (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2006).
			State-of-the-art word alignment models, such as IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993), HMM (Vogel et al., 1996), and the jointly-trained symmetric HMM (Liang et al., 2006), contain a large number of parameters (e.g., word translation probabilities) that need to be estimated in addition to the desired hidden alignment variables.
			The most common method of inference in such models is expectation-maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977) or an approximation to EM when exact EM is intractable.
			However, being a maxi mization (e.g., maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP)) technique, EM is generally prone to local optima and overfitting.
			In essence, the alignment distribution obtained via EM takes into account only the most likely point in the parameter space, but does not consider contributions from other points.
			Problems with the standard EM estimation of IBM Model 1 was pointed out by Moore (2004) and a number of heuristic changes to the estimation procedure, such as smoothing the parameter estimates, were shown to reduce the alignment error rate, but the effects on translation performance was not reported.
			Zhao and Xing (2006) note that the parameter estimation (for which they use variational EM) suffers from data sparsity and use symmetric Dirichlet priors, but they find the MAP solution.
			Bayesian inference, the approach in this paper, have recently been applied to several unsupervised learning problems in NLP (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson et al., 2007) as well as to other tasks in SMT such as synchronous grammar induction (Blunsom et al., 2009) and learning phrase alignments directly (DeNero et al., 2008).
			Word alignment learning problem was addressed jointly with segmentation learning in Xu et al.
			(2008), Nguyen et al.
			(2010), and Chung and Gildea (2009).
			The former two works place nonparametric priors (also known as cache models) on the parameters and utilize Gibbs sampling.
			However, alignment inference in neither of these works is exactly Bayesian since the alignments are updated by running GIZA++ (Xu et al., 2008) or by local maximization (Nguyen et al., 2010).
			On the other hand, 182 Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics:shortpapers, pages 182–187, Portland, Oregon, June 1924, 2011.
			Qc 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics Chung and Gildea (2009) apply a sparse Dirichlet prior on the multinomial parameters to prevent over- fitting.
			They use variational Bayes for inference, but they do not investigate the effect of Bayesian inference to word alignment in isolation.
			Recently, Zhao and Gildea (2010) proposed fertility extensions to IBM Model 1 and HMM, but they do not place any prior on the parameters and their inference method is actually stochastic EM (also known as Monte Carlo EM), a ML technique in which sampling is used to fj is associated with a hidden alignment variable aj whose value ranges over the word positions in the corresponding source sentence.
			The set of alignments for a sentence (corpus) is denoted by a (A).The model parameters consist of a VE × VF ta ble T of word translation probabilities such that te,f = P (f |e).
			The joint distribution of the Model-1 variables is given by the following generative model3: n approximate the expected counts in the E-step.
			Even though they report substantial reductions in align P (E, F, A; T) = P (e)P (a|e)P (f |a, e; T) (1) s J ment error rate, the translation BLEU scores do not improve.
			Our approach in this paper is fully Bayesian in = n P (e) (I + 1)J s n t j=1 eaj ,fj (2) which the alignment probabilities are inferred by integrating over all possible parameter values assuming an intuitive, sparse prior.
			We develop a Gibbs sampler for alignments under IBM Model 1, In the proposed Bayesian setting, we treat T as a random variable with a prior P (T).
			To find a suitable prior for T, we rewrite (2) as: (e) VE VFwhich is relevant for the state-of-the-art SMT sys tems since: (1) Model 1 is used in bootstrapping the parameter settings for EM training of higher P (E, F, A|T) = n s P (I + 1)J n n (t e=1 f =1 e,f )ne,f (3) VE VF P (e)order alignment models, and (2) many state-of-the = n n (te,f )Ne,f n J (4)art SMT systems use Model 1 translation probabilities as features in their log-linear model.
			We eval e=1 f =1 (I + 1) s uate the inferred alignments in terms of the end-to- end translation performance, where we show the results with a variety of input data to illustrate the general applicability of the proposed technique.
			To our knowledge, this is the first work to directly investigate the effects of Bayesian alignment inference on translation performance.
	
	
			Given a sentence-aligned parallel corpus (E, F), let ei (fj ) denote the i-th (j-th) source (target)1 word in e (f ), which in turn consists of I (J ) words and denotes the s-th sentence in E (F).2 Each source sentence is also hypothesized to have an additional imaginary “null” word e0.
			Also let VE (VF ) denote the size of the observed source (target) vocabulary.
			In Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993), each target word 1 We use the “source” and “target” labels following the generative process, in which E generates F (cf.
			Eq. 1).

Since the distribution over {te,f } in (4) is in the exponential family, specificallybeing a multinomial distribution, we choose the con jugate prior, in this case the Dirichlet distribution, for computational convenience.
			For each source word type e, we assume the prior distribution for te = te,1 · · · te,VF , which is itself a distribution over the target vocabulary, to be a Dirichlet distribution (with its own set of hyperparameters Θe = θe,1 · · · θe,VF ) independent from the priors of other source word types: te ∼ Dirichlet(te; Θe) fj |a, e, T ∼ Multinomial(fj ; teaj ) We choose symmetric Dirichlet priors identically for all source words e with θe,f = θ = 0.0001 to obtain a sparse Dirichlet prior.

			For Turkish↔English experiments, we used the 20K-sentence travel domain BTEC dataset (Kikui et al., 2006) from the yearly IWSLT evaluations6 for training, the CSTAR 2003 test set for development, and the IWSLT 2004 test set for testing7.

			Using P (E, F, A; Θ) obtained in (6), the Gibbs sampling formula for the individual alignments is derived as:4 P (aj = i|E, F, Aj ; Θ) task8 for training, news2008 set for development, news2009 set for testing, and the 438M-word English and 81.7M-word Czech monolingual news corpora for additional language model (LM) training.
			For Arabic↔English, we used the 65K-sentence LDC2004T18 (news from 20012004) for training, the AFP portion of LDC2004T17 (news from 1998, j = ei ,fj + θei ,fj (7) single reference) for development and testing (about L.VF j VF f =1 N ,f + L.f =1 θei ,f where the superscript j denotes the exclusion of the current value of aj . The algorithm is given in Table 1.
			Initialization of A in Step 1 can be arbitrary, but for faster convergence special initializations have been used, e.g., using the output of EM (Chiang et al., 2010).
			Once the Gibbs sampler is deemed to have converged after B burn-in iterations, we collect M samples of A with L iterations in-between5 to estimate P (A|E, F).
			To obtain the Viterbi alignments, which are required for phrase extraction (Koehn et al., 2003), we select for each aj the most frequent value in the M collected samples.

			All language models are 4-gram in the travel domain experiments and 5-gram in the news domain experiments.
			For each language pair, we trained standard phrase-based SMT systems in both directions (including alignment symmetrization and log-linear model tuning) using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), SRILM (Stolcke, 2002), and ZMERT (Zaidan, 2009) tools and evaluated using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

			Table 2 compares the BLEU scores of Bayesian inference and EM estimation.
			In all translation tasks, Bayesian inference outperforms EM.
			The improvement range is from 2.59 (in Turkish-to-English) up to 2.99 (in English-to-Turkish) BLEU points in travel domain and from 0.16 (in English-to-Czech) up to 0.85 (in English-to-Arabic) BLEU points in news domain.
			Compared to the state-of-the-art IBM Model 4, the Bayesian Model 1 is better in all travel domain tasks and is comparable or better in the news domain.
			Fertility of a source word is defined as the number of target words aligned to it.
			Table 3 shows the distribution of fertilities in alignments obtained from different methods.
			Compared to EM estimation, including Model 4, the proposed Bayesian inference dramatically reduces “questionable” high-fertility (4≤ fertility ≤ 7) alignments and almost entirely elim Table 3: Distribution of inferred alignment fertilities.
			The four blocks of rows from top to bottom correspond to (in order) the total number of source tokens, source tokens with fertilities in the range 4–7, source tokens with fertilities higher than 7, and the maximum observed fertility.
