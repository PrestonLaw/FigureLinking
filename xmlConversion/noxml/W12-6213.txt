		Representing a morphological analyzer as a finite-state transducer (FST) confers many advantages over running a procedural affix-matching algorithm.
		Apart from application speed, an FST representation immediately offers various possibilities to flexibly modify a grammar.
		In the case of Arabic, this is illustrated through the addition of the ability to correctly parse partially vocalized forms without overgeneration, something not possible in the original analyzer, as well as to serve both as an analyzer and a generator.
	
	
			Many lexicon-driven morphological analysis systems rely on a general strategy of breaking down input words into constituent parts by consulting customized lexicons and rules designed for a particular language.
			The constraints imposed by the lexica designed are then implemented as program code that handles co-occurrence restrictions and analysis of possible orthographic variants, finally producing a parse of the input word.
			Some systems designed along these lines are meant for general use, such as the hunspell tool (Hala´csy et al., 2004) which allows users to specify lexicons and constraints, while others are language-dependent, such as the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004).
			In this paper we examine the possibility of converting such morphological analysis tools to FSTs that perform the same task.
			As a case study, we have chosen to implement a one-to-one faithful conversion of the Buckwalter Arabic analyzer into a finite- state representation using the foma finite state compiler (Hulden, 2009b), while also adding some extensions to the original analyzer.
			These are useful extensions which are difficult to add to the original Perl-based analyzer because of its procedural nature, but very straightforward to perform in a finite-state environment using standard design techniques.
			There are several advantages to representing morphological analyzers as FSTs, as is well noted in the literature.
			Here, in addition to documenting the conversion, we shall also discuss and give examples of the flexibility, extensibility, and speed of application which results from using a finite-state representation of a morphology.1
	
	
			Without going into an extensive linguistic discussion, we shall briefly describe the widely used Buck- walter morphological analyzer for Arabic.
			The BAMA accepts as input Arabic words, with or without vocalization, and produces as output a breakdown of the affixes participating in the word, the stem, together with information about conjugation classes.
			For example, for the input word ktb/ .._. �s', BAMA returns, among others: LOOK-UP WORD: ktb SOLUTION 1: (kataba) [katabu_1] katab/VERB_PERFECT +a/PVSUFF_SUBJ:3MS (GLOSS): + write + he/it <verb> 1 The complete code and analyzer are available at.

			<k,tb,∅>, while accepted in the previousstep, is now rejected because the file dict Prefixes lists k as a prefix belonging to class NPrefBi, and the stem tb belonging to one of PV V, IV V, NF, PV C, or IV C. However, the compatibility file tableAB does not permit a combination of prefix class NPrefBi and any of the above-mentioned stem classes.

			The BAMA lookup process is illustrated using a different example in figure 1.
			3 Conversion.
			Our goal in the conversion of the Perl-code and the lookup tables is to produce a single transducer that maps input words directly to their morphological analysis, including class and gloss information.
			In order to do this, we break the process down into three major steps: (1) We construct a transducer Lexicon that accepts on its output side strings consisting of any combinations of fully vocalized prefixes, stems, and suffixes listed in dictPrefixes, dict- Stems, and dictSuffixes.
			On the input side, we find a string that represents the class each morpheme on the output side corresponds to, as well as the line number in the correspond LEXICON Prefixes Prefixes ; tableBC, which lists co-occurrence constraints between stems and suffixes contains only the [Pref-%0]{P%:34}:0 Stems; [PrefWa]{P%:37}:wa Stems; ...
			LEXICON Stems [Nprop]{S%:23}:|b Suffixes; [Nprop]{S%:27}:%<ib˜ Suffixes; ...
			LEXICON Suffixes [Suff-%0]{X%:34}:0 #; [CVSuff-o]{X%:37}:o #; ...
			Figure 2: Skeleton of basic lexicon transducer in LEXC generated from BAMA lexicons.
			ing file where the morpheme appears.
			For example, the Lexicon transducer would contain the mapping: [Pref0]{P:34}[PV]{S:102658}[NSuff-a]{X:72} kataba indicating that for the surface form kataba/ .._ . � , the prefix class is Pref0 appearing on line 34 in the file efixes, the stem class is PV, appearing on line 102,658 in dictStems, and that the suffix class is NSuff-a, appearing on line 72 in dictSuffixes.
			To construct the Lexicon, we produced a Perl-script that reads the contents of the BAMA files and automatically constructs a LEXC- format file (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003), which is compiled with foma into a finite transducer (see figure 2).
			(2) We construct rule transducers that filter out impossible combinations of prefix classes based on the data in the constraint tables tableAB, tableBC, and tableAC.
			We then iteratively compose the Lexicon transducer with each rule transducer.
			This is achieved by converting each suffix class mentioned in each of the class files to a constraint rule, which is compiled following lines beginning with Nhy: Nhy NSuff-h Nhy NSuffiy indicating that the Nhy-class only combines with Nsuff-h or Nsuffiy.
			These lines are converted by our script into the constraint restriction regular expression: def Rule193 "[Nhy]" => _ ?* "[NSuff-h]"|"[NSuffiy]"]; This in effect defines the language where each instance [Nhy] is always followed sometime later in the string by either [NSuff-h], or [NSuffiy].
			By composing this, and the other constraints, with the Lexicon- transducer, we can filter out all illegitimate combinations of morphemes as dictated by the original Buckwalter files, by calculating: def Grammar Lexicon.i .o. Rule1 .o. ...
			RuleNNN ; In this step, it is crucial to note that one cannot in practice build a separate, single transducer (or automaton) that models the intersection of all the lexicon constraints, i.e. Rule1 .o. Rule2 .o. ...
			RuleNNN, and then compose that transducer with the Lexicon transducer.
			The reason for this is that the size of the intersection of all co-occurrence rules grows exponentially with each rule.
			To avoid this intermediate exponential size, the Lexicon transducer must be composed with the first rule, whose composition is then composed with the second rule, etc., as above.
			(3) As the previous two steps leave us with a transducer that accepts only legitimate combinations of fully vocalized prefixes, stems, and suffixes, we proceed to optionally remove short vowel diacritics as well as perform optional normalization of the letter Alif ( ) from the for instance, that an intermediate kataba/ .._. �s', would be mapped to the surface forms kataba, katab, katba, katb, ktaba, ktab, ktba, and ktb.
			This last step assures that we can parse partially vocalized forms, fully vocalized forms, completely unvocalized forms, and common variants of Alif.
			def RemoveShortVowels [a|u|i|o|%˜|%‘] (->) 0; def NormalizeAlif ["|"|"<"|">"] (->) A .o. "{" (->) [A|"<"] ; def RemovefatHatAn [F|K|N] -> 0; def BAMA 0 <- %{|%} .o. Grammar .o. RemoveShortVowels .o. NormalizeAlif .o. RemovefatHatAn; 4 Results.
			Converting the entire BAMA grammar as described above produces a final FST of 855,267 states and 1,907,978 arcs, which accepts 14,563,985,397 Arabic surface forms.
			The transducer occupies 8.5Mb.
			An optional auxiliary transducer for mapping line numbers to complete long glosses and class names occupies an additional 10.5 Mb.
			This is slightly more than the original BAMA files which occupy 4.0Mb.
			However, having a FST representation of the grammar provides us with a number of advantages not available in the original BAMA, some of which we will briefly discuss.
			4.1 Orthographical variants.
			The original BAMA deals with spelling variants and substandard spelling by performing Perlregex replacements to the input string if lookup fails.
			In the BAMA documentation, we find replacements such as: - word final Y’ should be y’ - word final Y’ should be } - word final y’ should be } In a finite-state system, once the grammar is converted, we can easily build such search heuristics rules and various composition strategies such as priority union (Kaplan, 1987).
			We can thus mimic the behavior of the BAMA, albeit without incurring any extra lookup time.
			4.2 Vocalization.
			As noted above, by constructing the analyzer from the fully vocalized forms and then optionally removing vowels in surface variants allows us to more accurately parse partially vocalized Arabic forms.
			We thus rectify one of the drawbacks of the original BAMA, which makes no use of vocalization information even when it is provided.
			For example, given an input word qabol, BAMA would as a first step strip off all the vocalization marks, producing qbl.
			During the parsing process, BAMA could then match qbl with, for instance, qibal, an entirely different word, even though vowels were indicated.
			The FST design addresses this problem elegantly: if the input word is qabol, it will never match qibal because the vocalized morphemes are used throughout the construction of the FST and only optionally removed from the surface forms, whereas BAMA used the un- vocalized forms to match input.
			This behavior is in line with other finite-state implementations of Arabic, such as Beesley (1996), where diacritics, if they happen to be present, are taken advantage of in order to disambiguate and rule out illegitimate parses.
			This is of practical importance when parsing Arabic as writers often partially disambiguate words depending on context.
			For example, the word Hsbt/ .._ . -�is ambiguous (Hasabat = compute, charge; Hasibat = regard, consider).
			One would partially vocalize Hsbt as Hsibt to denote “she regards”, or as Hsabt to imply “she computes.” The FST-based system correctly narrows down the parses accordingly, while BAMA would produce all ambiguities regardless of the vocalization in the input.
			4.3 Surface lexicon extraction.
			Having the BAMA represented as a FST also allows us to extract the output projection of the grammar, producing an automaton that only accepts legitimate words in Arabic.
			This can be then be used in spell checking applications, for example, by integrating the lexicon with weighted transduc ers reflecting frequency information and error models (Hulden, 2009a; Pirinen et al., 2010).
			4.4 Constraint analysis.
			Interestingly, the BAMA itself contains a vast amount of redundant information in the co- occurrence constraints.
			That is, some suffix-stem- lexicon constraints are entirely subsumed by other constraints and could be removed without affecting the overall system.
			This can be observed during the chain of composition of the various transducers representing lexicon constraints.
			If a constraint X fails to remove any words from the lexicon—something that can be ascertained by noting that the number of paths through the new transducer is the same as in the transducer before composition—it is an indication that a previous constraint Y has already subsumed X . In short, the constraint X is redundant.
			The original grammar cannot be consistently analyzed for redundancies as it stands.
			However, redundant constraints can be detected when compiling the Lexicon FST together with the set of rules, offering a way to streamline the original grammar.
			5 Conclusion.
			We have shown a method for converting the table- based and producedural constraint-driven Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer into an equivalent finite-state transducer.
			By doing so, we can take advantage of established finite-state methods to provide faster and more flexible parsing and also use the finite-state calculus to produce derivative applications that were not possible using the original table- driven Perl parser, such as spell checkers, normalizers, etc. The finite-state transducer implementation also allows us to parse words with any vocalization without sacrificing accuracy.
			While the conversion method in this case is specific to the BAMA, the general principle illustrated in this paper can be applied to many other procedural morphologies that rule out morphological parses by first consulting a base lexicon and subsequently applying a batch of serial or parallel constraints over affix occurrence.
